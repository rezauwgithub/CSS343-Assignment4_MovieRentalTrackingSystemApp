Notes:
I worked alone (agreed upon with Min Chen) for the implementation 
of this project and noted this in all of the files. Any assumptions 
that I have made are listed in comments. Also in comments, are design 
decisions and specific things to look out for. For example, my BSTree
class is templatized, and therefore, I had some difficulty
compiling it on Linux. After consulting the instructor and
some online resources, I combined the .h and the .cpp into
one .h file. This is sub-optimal but has been noted. In 
the BSTree class, I even give a quote that state why it is
best to keep templatized classes in the same .h file. Please
see the quote (it is at the bottom). 


Decisions:
I made all the factories static so no objects had to be made.
Transactions are performed as they are read so no transactions
need to be stored (although, my original design DID store 
transactions before performing them). History and Inventory
transactions are NOT stored in any customer history. 


Instructions:
Nothing special was done to compile this code.
All you need to do is un-zip the zip and make sure 
all files are in the same directory. In linux, use
g++ *.cpp and the code should compile just fine (it did for me).
run the program using ./a.out. For memory leaks you can use the
command valgrind --leak-check=yes ./a.out.
